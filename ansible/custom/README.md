# Ansible Collection - oswee.custom

To test roles via Molecule run `mkdir -p ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/oswee/custom/ && ln -s $PWD/roles ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/oswee/custom/`
from the `./ansible/custom/` directory. This will "loopback" to the current collection roles.
This collection contains personalized tooling setup and mostly depends on `oswee.core` collection.
