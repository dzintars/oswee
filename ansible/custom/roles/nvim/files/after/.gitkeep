This is loaded after all runtimepath directories (or `plugin` directory).
This directory can mimic the runtimepath directory structure.
For example it can contain `after/plugins`, `after/ftdetect`, `after/ftplugin`, etc.
So... put the global things in the runtimepath directories and put the any overrides in this directory.

In this directory you can override Vim's internal options.

In general this is considired to be like a hack directory. You should strive not to use it.
