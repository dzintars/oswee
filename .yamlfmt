## This is example configuration.
## I don't like the limitations of it. For example i can't set 2 spaces for inline comments or document_end.

# include:
# # - integration_test/**/*.yaml
#   - .yamlfmt

formatter:
  type: basic
  indent: 2
  include_document_start: true
  line_ending: lf
  retain_line_breaks: true
  emoji_support: true
