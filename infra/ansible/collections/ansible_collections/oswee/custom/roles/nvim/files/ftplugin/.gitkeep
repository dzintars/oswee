Naming of these files matters!
After setting `ftdetect` for a file, Vim will lookup for corresponding `ftplugin` by the filename matching the filetype.
You can also create the directories there. For example you could have `lua` directory there with bunch of files.
Every time Vim will detect `lua` filetype it will execute all *.vim files in this `lua` directory.
Most likely you will use it for some exotic languages.

These files should contain only "buffer scoped" options.
If you will set some global options, then Vim will owerride them for all open buffers which most likely is not what you want.
